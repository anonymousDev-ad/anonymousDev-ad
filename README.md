- 👋 Hi, I’m @anonymousDev-ad
- 👀 I’m interested in front and backend web and mobile development 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend web development 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on -- not ready to collaborate yet
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can't. I'm usually in my starship somewhere in the milky way galaxy. I only spend about 20% of my time actually stationed on Earth.
